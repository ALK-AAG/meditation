                If you’ve never meditated before, now is the time to start. You might be scrunching your face and thinking, “What good would meditating do for me? It’s just a waste of time, sitting there.” Totally understandable. In today’s world, we’re all about using every minute of every day to be productive. If we’re not doing something, it seems like we’re wasting our time. But recent changes to what life looks like have caused many to pay extra attention to their mental resilience.

                Why we need meditation
            </h2>
            <p class="first-para">The pace of our world today is exactly why we need meditation. With social media <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2017/06/30/a-run-down-of-social-medias-effects-on-our-mental-health/#a01ace72e5af" target="_blank">pounding our mental health</a>, high levels of 
                stress (even in our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nmu.edu/sites/DrupalEducation/files/UserFiles/Files/Pre-Drupal/SiteSections/Students/GradPapers/Projects/Kusz_Marcy_MP.pdf">elementary students</a> ), and what the U.S. Health Department calls the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/enews/past-issues/2019/january-17/loneliness-epidemic" target="_blank">“Loneliness Epidemic”</a> we’ve never had a 
                greater need for meditation in every area of our lives.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, meditation is being taught in our schools and in the workplace, and experts on meditation are teaching you how to do it in 
                the quiet of your own home.

                    <h3>Meditation at home. </h3>
                    <p class="first-para">Hopefully you can find time for quiet at home. Just a few minutes to listen to your own breathing. </p>
                    <p>But what about your children? Family psychologists are finding that our children barely have time to breathe, let alone listen to their breathing. And when there is time for quiet, a screen quickly takes its place. But there is a surge in parenting blogs teaching about “the benefits of quiet time.”

Create quiet time in your home. Whether it’s for you or for your kids, it’s worth it. </p>

                    <p>Our children are struggling with <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/129/1/e232.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incredible amounts of stress</a>. Many schools and teachers are trying to do something about it. Just a few years ago, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/education-meditation-after-school-program-holistic-life-504747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">news of a school</a> in West Baltimore using meditation instead of detention and its powerful impact on students was all over online and print news. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More schools have started practicing <a href="https://www.mindful.org/mindfulness-in-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yoga during P.E.</a>, teachers set up a <a href="https://www.mindful.org/mindfulness-in-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time each day for mindfulness</a> exercises, and <a href="https://www.educationdive.com/news/meditation-at-schools-can-benefit-both-learning-and-behavior/531942/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a> studies on meditation in school is showing a positive impact on both learning and behavior.    
                    </p>
                    <p>Why this big push in our workplaces and schools? The long and short of it is the more we are inundated with social media and world news, the more stressed we become. The incredible villain of comparison tells us we must be “all the things,” and we need to push our children to be the same. Thankfully, meditation and mindfulness are there to help us make sense of it all.

                        Mindfulness is total awareness. It’s allowing the conscious mind to saturate and fill the present moment. You allow in all the sensory things around you, if a car alarm goes off or a dog is barking, you let it in. We’re aware of it. We’re allowing it to be how it is, and we come back to the breath. We don’t allow ourselves to be concerned. We accept things as they are and know that they’re temporary.

                            I think the most tangible effects that I experienced from meditation started with being able to create some space between my awareness and what I was experiencing. So, I started to develop a relationship with my own mind, where there was some breathing room between who I am and what I am and the thoughts I was having.

                    <p>As Ben says, “The thoughts that we have don’t just occur in our brain, they occur in our entire nervous system. So, when you have a thought in your mind, notice what part of your body responds to that thought.</p>
                    <p>Ben noticed that when he was stressed, he didn’t breathe as deeply and decreased the amount of oxygen to his body. Meditation helped moderate that, and now he knows that when he’s stressed, deep breaths can make a huge difference. </p>

            <h3>How to meditate properly:</h3>
            <p>First of all, there is no “one way” to meditate. For some, sitting cross-legged and closing their eyes works best. Others lay flat on their backs. Still, others find that meditating while practicing yoga is the most effective. Some like perfect quiet. Others listen to calming music. However you meditate, here are some universal principles to keep in mind:</p>

It means that I’m being loving and generous in the ways that I can be. I feel blessed now. I feel a lot more flexible. I feel a lot more open to sharing and being present with other people.”  </p>

I feel attracted to the truth. I feel welcomed into places. I feel appreciated. I feel understood. I feel loved. And I think a lot of that comes from my ability to even be more honest with people. When you’re not honest with people, they can’t access you. You’re not giving them the opportunity to even love you for who you are. So, I think that my integrity has increased. My ability to acknowledge my character defects has increased. I feel a lot more honest, a lot more happy, a lot more loving, and a lot more respectful.”</p>
